# MongoDB CRUD - Practice 10

## Requirement

Count all the `female` from `Paris` and `male` from `Cracow` that have all of the following properties:

- `flat`
- `house`
- `land`

At least one of the properties must be valued at more than `$2,000,000`, and none of the properties under `$500,000`.

*Hint, assets are stored in the field "wealth.realEstates"*

## Solution

```agg
db.people.find({$and: [ 
 {$or: [ {$and: [ {"sex" : "female"}, {"address.city": "Paris"}  ] }, 
  {$and: [ {"sex" : "male"}, {"address.city": "Cracow"} ] } ] },
 {"wealth.realEstates": {$elemMatch: {"type": "flat"}}}, 
 {"wealth.realEstates": {$elemMatch: {"type": "house"}}}, 
 {"wealth.realEstates": {$elemMatch: {"type": "land"}}}, 
 {"wealth.realEstates": {$elemMatch: {"worth": {$gt: 2000000}}}}, 
 {"wealth.realEstates": {$not: {$elemMatch: {"worth": {$lt: 500000}}}}} 
]}).count()

```

## Result

```result
23
```
