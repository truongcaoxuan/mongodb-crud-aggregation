## Step-by-step guide to installing MongoDB, the MongoDB Shell (mongosh), and MongoDB Compass on Windows

### Step 1: Install MongoDB

- Visit the MongoDB download page: <https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community>
- Under the "Community Server" section, select "Windows" as your operating system.
- Choose the appropriate version (64-bit recommended) and click the "Download" button.
- Once the download is complete, run the installer executable (.msi).
- Follow the installation wizard's prompts. You can typically choose the "Complete" setup type and accept the default settings.
- During installation, make sure to check the box that says "Install MongoDB Compass," which will install the MongoDB GUI client as well.
- Complete the installation process.

### Step 2: Add MongoDB Bin Directory to PATH

- After installing MongoDB, add the MongoDB bin directory to your system's PATH environment variable. This allows you to run MongoDB commands from any command prompt.
- Search for "Environment Variables" in the Windows Start menu and open the "Edit the system environment variables" option.
- In the "System Properties" window, click the "Environment Variables" button.
- Under "System variables," select the "Path" variable and click "Edit."
- Click "New" and add the path to the MongoDB bin directory, which is usually something like `C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\<version>\bin`.
- Click "OK" to close the windows and save the changes.

### Step 3: Install MongoDB Compass

- During the MongoDB installation in Step 1, you should have selected to install MongoDB Compass as well. If not, you can download it separately from here: <https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/compass>
- Choose the appropriate version (64-bit recommended) and click the "Download" button.
- Once the download is complete, run the installer executable (.exe).
- Follow the installation prompts. You can generally accept the default settings.
- Complete the installation process.

### Step 4: Install MongoDB Shell (mongosh)

- Visit the MongoDB Shell (mongosh) download page: <https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/shell>
- Under the "Community Edition" section, select "Windows" as your operating system.
- Choose the appropriate version (64-bit recommended) and click the "Download" button.
- Once the download is complete, extract the contents of the downloaded archive to a directory of your choice.
- Add the directory containing the extracted mongosh files to your system's PATH environment variable, similar to Step 2.

### Step 5: Verify Installations

- Open a new command prompt or PowerShell window.
- To verify MongoDB installation, type:

```cmd
mongod --version
```

- To verify MongoDB Compass installation, search for "MongoDB Compass" in the Windows Start menu and open the application.
- To verify mongosh installation, type:

```cmd
mongosh --version
```

Congratulations! You've successfully installed MongoDB, MongoDB Shell (mongosh), and MongoDB Compass on your Windows system. You're now ready to start working with MongoDB databases and exploring data using MongoDB Compass.
